# Amazon-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
This project performs sentiment analysis on Amazon fine food reviews. It compares the performance of two distinct methods: a lexicon-based model (VADER) and a transformer-based model (RoBERTa) to classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative. The notebook includes a detailed comparison of model accuracy and results.
