# Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset using two different models: VADER (a lexicon-based approach) and a pre-trained RoBERTa model (a transformer-based approach). The goal is to compare their performance in classifying reviews as positive, neutral, or negative.
